This module allows you to install Bromite webview systemlessly. With Bromite, you can block ads and trackers and resist fingerprinting. The numbers after the dash in the version is the bromite version used

<h3>What is a webview?</h3>

A webview is like a minimal browser, but for non-browsers that display web content in any other way than sending you to a browser or custom tab, like Outlook or GoDaddy apps or even some banking apps

**PLEASE NOTE SOME APPS WON'T WORK WITHOUT GOOGLE WEBVIEW**. I can't fix that and any issues on it will be closed and ignored

<h3>Credits</h3>

<h3> ETAs</h3>

This module probably won't be updated with each Bromite update but I will try to keep it updated at least with major versions

<h3>Compatibility</h3>

- Android 5 or higher
- Magisk v18.2+
- **ONLY FLASH THROUGH MAGISK MANAGER AS IT REQUIRES AN INTERNET CONNECTION**

**Please note** your ROM must support using "com.android.webview" as the webview and not have a pinned signature for the app.

To see if it does:

From termux, under a non root ($) shell:

- cp /system/framework/framework-res.apk ~

- aapt d xmltree framework-res.apk res/xml/config_webview_packages.xml

The output should contain. "com.android.webview" and not contain a "E:" with a bunch of characters under that.
